Hello! This is my Website I have made for the last Fourth Year Project! I have been able to design and create it due to the skills I have learned in my Web Design class.
</p>
  </div>
<p> 
I can use my skills here to create websites for my business, my friends and family, my C.V, blog or articles. As well as any games or more experiment stuff (which is what the web is really all about). 
</p>
  <div class="content">
           <h4>Intro</h4>
			 <p>Going into Fouth Year, I was very excited, as in the past three years I had always seen Fourth Years in their tracksuits, doing fun activities and enjoying school time a lot. It had seemed like a great year full of cool opportunities and things to do.
			  </p>
            <p>
            Now, looking back I feel like the year has gone by very quickly. I can remember things like my trip to Gartan near the start of the year very clearly, and I can't believe that the end of this year is only a few weeks ahead. 
           	  </p>
            <h4>Gaisce</h4>
            <p>
            At the start of the year I decided to take upon the challenge of the Gaisce Award. For this I needed to choose a personal skill to develop, a sport to do and Community Volunteering. I chose to help out in my local Cubs meetings every Tuesday to help out the leaders. I am already in Ventures so I knew some of the Cubs from previous camps and activities. I really enjoyed this as I was given responsibility for the kids, and was given freedom to think of ideas for games, activities and lessons to do with them.
				</p>
	<blockquote>For the sport I chose to do Rock Climbing. I had been doing this regularly for a couple of weeks prior so it made sense to continue. I was introduced to it by my friends, who brought me to The Wall in Sandyford Industrial Estate. This was the section of the Gaisce that I chose to do for 26 weeks. I have almost completed that, and am happy to say that I feel I have greatly improved. I still go there atleast once a week on the weekend and will continue to do so. I am happy I decided to keep at it as otherwise I am not too active besides hikes and other things with Scouts/Ventures. It definitely has improved my upper-body strength and endurance.
	</blockquote>
            <blockquote>As for the Personal Skill, I decided to do coding. This ranged from teaching myself some basics in C++, to advancing my abilites in Web Design. I really enjoy being able to create my own things for people to see. Understanding how to make programs do what I want is really cool, like knowing how if I fail to put in the right password multiple times, it will quit, or display a message/hint. One of my online friends has also been helping me understand how to make plugins for one of the video games I play, CS:GO.

	<h4>Gartan</h4>
            <p>
            Near the start of the year, half of the year-group went to Uisce and the other half went to Gartan Adventure Centre. I was sent to Gartan for 3 days, where we did many different types of activities such as kayaking, canoeing, indoor Rock Climbing, and others. At the beginning of the trip, I wasn't too happy as I didn't really know why we were there or what we were going to do.
           	  </p>
            <blockquote>
            We were then split into further groups, and with these we did our activities with. I enjoyed the Rock Climbing as I had previous experience in it, along with the kayaking. I had done kayaking before so I was able to do the challenges and tasks pretty easily. I also enjoyed it as we had to then play games like standing up and swapping kayaks with someone across the circle. Over the coming days, we also did things such as a mud run, where I got absolutely soaked and caked in mud and water. Things like these were hilarious and fun because I had all my good friends around and we all were going through the same things.
    </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            Eating breakfasts, lunches and dinners together was fun, and I think made us closer all friends, as we were sharing so much time together and having a laugh. I really enjoyed the time I spent in Gartan, and would definitely recommend it to the future years.

	<h4>Charity Bazaar</h4>
            <p>
            One of the things I volunteered myself to do was the International Charity Bazaar that was being held in town. What I had to do was just try sell raffle tickets, give them in and collect money. I enjoyed it as I got to represent my school (and miss out on school). I talked with a lot of different people from all sorts of countries and got to experience many different cultures. I also tried many samples of exotic foods which was a plus!
    </p>
	<h4>Winter Formal</h4>
            <p>
            One of my friends Tehya organised a Winter Formal dance for January. Nearly the whole year went, and everyone enjoyed it! You had to wear 
     suits and ties, which sent me off to Penneys looking for its finest clothes. Another thing were the dates, you had to ask someone to go with you as your &quot;date&quot;, but it was all a bit of fun.</p>

            <p>All of my friends had a blast and will be a great memory to look back on in the future.</p>
